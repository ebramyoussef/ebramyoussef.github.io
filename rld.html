				<h2>Period Doubling and Chaotic Behavior in an RLD Circuit</h2>
				<p>
					This project was conducted as part of the Advanced Experimental Techniques physics class (PHYS 243W, Fall 2022) at the University of Rochester
					during my senior Fall semester. An experiment investigating the period doubling and chaotic behavior in nonlinear systems such as a
					resistor-inductor-diode (RLD) circuit was implemented. Various driving voltages were inputted to the circuit at a resonance frequency of 260 kHz,
					and the output voltage of the circuit’s response was recorded over time. In order to analyze the circuit’s behavior, I developed and implemented
					a numerical algorithm that reads in the raw data resulting from each driving voltage, performs data cleanup and smoothing, then identifies the number,
					as well as the peak voltage value, of distinct peaks in the system’s response to each driving voltage, and stores these values in an array, which was
					then used to plot a bifurcation diagram (Peak output voltage vs peak input voltage) for the system to high levels of accuracy. The analyzed data was
					also used to calculate experimental values of both Feigenbaum constants, both of which agreed with their theoretical counterparts within the 
					uncertainty bounds. The produced bifurcation diagram exhibits multiple interesting characteristics, such as period doubling, eventual chaos,
					and islands of stability. As shown below, the bifurcation diagram I produced (left) is in good qualitative agreement with a numerically simulated
					bifurcation diagram produced by the authors of a 1998 study (<a href ="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.166256" target="_blank">Controlling chaos in a fast diode 
					resonator using extended time-delay autosynchronization: Experimental observations and theoretical analysis</a>), despite differences in the circuit setup and goal
					of the study, which might be considered an indicator for generalized usability and efficacy of my algorithm. The source code to my algorithm could be provided
					to interested parties over email.
