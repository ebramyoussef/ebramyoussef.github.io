				<h2>Reproducing numerical results by Moloney and Gubbels et al.</h2>
				<p>
					The algorithm used for reproducing the results by Akhmediev et al. was adapted to suit the physical parameters and geometry
					of a study by Gubbels et al. and Moloney (1987) named <a href="https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.4.001837" target="_blank">“Numerical study of soliton
					emission from a nonlinear waveguide.”</a> Similar to my previous project reproducing the numerical results by Akhmediev et al.,
					this project was aimed at testing my SSFM-based algorithm on problems with similar formalism and differential equations that have known 
					trusted numerical results. However, the physical setup proposed by this study was considerably more intricate and similar to the
					real-world problem we ultimately aim to solve (i.e., the nonlinear surface soliton project). Additionally, this study provided us with numerical results
					for far more diverse nonlinear scenarios, which, when reproduced to high accuracy, gave us more confidence in the algorithm and its deployment to solve new
					problems. Below is a presentation I presented to Professor Boyd and fellow group members at a group meeting in June 2022.
					This presentation contains more details about the original study, as well as the original and reproduced numerical results in a variety of situations
					(i.e., the ‘ideal’ case, in the presence of linear absorption, in the presence of angular and transverse beam misalignment, and in the case of saturation).
					In all cases, the original results are shown on the left and my results are on the right. In all of the reproduced results,
					the initial (beginning of propagation) wave is in black, while the final (end of propagation) wave is in blue.
