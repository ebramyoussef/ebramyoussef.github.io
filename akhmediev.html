				<h2>Reproducing numerical results by Akhmediev et al.</h2>
				<p>
					Another MATLAB numerical simulation that uses the SSFM algorithm to numerically solve 
					and simulate the NLSE in a linear-nonlinear geometry. In this case, the algorithm was used 
					to reproduce the numerical results found by Akhmediev et al. (1984) in his paper 
					<a href="http://www.jetp.ras.ru/cgi-bin/dn/e_061_01_0062.pdf" target="_blank">“Excitation of nonlinear surface waves by 
					Gaussian light beams.” </a> The main purpose of this project was to test my SSFM code on problems with similar formalism
					and differential equations that have known trusted numerical results. Although the numerical methods used by the original authors
					(perturbation and inverse iteration) was significantly different, the results produced by my code utilizing the SSFM algorithm 
					and the fast Fourier transform produced almost identical results in a much smaller runtime. Although the problem proposed by 
					the authors of the aforementioned article is somewhat different than the ones we seek to solve, using this algorithm to reproduce
					results with high accuracy meant that we could trust the accuracy of our code when used on other problems with unknown results 
					(i.e., the ITO surface soliton problem we seek to solve) and proceed forward.
