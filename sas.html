				<h2>Doppler-free Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy of Rubidium D2 Transitions</h2>
				<p>
					This project was conducted as part of the Advanced Experimental Techniques physics class (PHYS 243W, Fall 2022) at the
					University of Rochester during my senior Fall semester. An experiment investigating the use of saturated absorption of
					rubidium vapor as a Doppler-free spectroscopy technique was conducted. The goal of this experiment is to identify narrow 
					spectral features and hyperfine structures in the Rubidium D2 line. For the purposes of this study, a diode laser was 
					utilized in a pump-probe optical setup in order to observe and record both Doppler-broadened and Doppler-free spectra.
					Analysis of the two spectra shows a higher resolution of atomic transitions was reached by saturated absorption, as proposed.
					A comparison of measured and theoretical transition frequencies of hyperfine-split ground and excited states of Rubidium 
					demonstrates relative agreement within the uncertainty limits of the measurements. Using Doppler-free saturated absorption
					resulted in an average reduction of 98.04% in the FWHM values of the absorption peaks, significantly increasing the accuracy
					and resolution of the observed spectral features. Additionally, the linewidth of the Doppler-free absorption peaks was comparable
					to that of the natural linewidth of rubidium (Gamma = 6 MHz), which intrinsically defines the lower limit of peak width, unlike
					the Doppler-broadened peaks, which were about 3 orders of magnitude greater. The document attached below is a full formal paper 
					discussing the experiment as well as my results, which was presented to and discussed with Professor Nicholas Bigelow as part of this class.
